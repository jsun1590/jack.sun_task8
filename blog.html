  <h1>Retro Review #72: Donky Kong</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h2>Published 04/10/2020</h2>
    <h2>By Jack Sun</h2>
  </section>
  <p>
    <img src="assets/images/dk.png" alt="Donky Kong">This week’s Retro Review features Nintendo’s arcade classic Donkey Kong-
    a fascinating game for all kinds of reasons. In the Eighties it was
    subject to all sorts of battles, as Universal unsuccessfully sued Nintendo
    over copyright infringement, while Atari and Coleco clashed over conversion
    rights. In the arcades the game has been the battlefield for vicious high
    score competitions, featuring stunning victories and astonishing allegations
    of cheating, and even inspired the documentary "The King Of Kong".
    <br><br>
    Donkey Kong himself went on to become a huge gaming star in his own right,
    appearing across a variety of platform games and a series of music games
    for the GameCube. Oh, and then there’s the small matter of the little bloke
    you play as, some guy named Mario. We don’t quite know what happened to him
    later on. Incidentally, one of our favourite versions of Donkey Kong is the
    excellent Game Boy game, which starts off like the arcade game before
    becoming an astonishing original puzzle platformer.
    <br><br> Do yourself a favour and
    buy this classic masterpiece for the NES on our online store now!

  <h1>Retro Review #66: Super Mario Bros 2</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h2>Published 04/10/2020</h2>
    <h2>By Jack Sun</h2>
  </section>
  <p>
    <img src="assets/images/smb2.png" alt="SMB 2">Super Mario Bros 2 was a
    game I rented early in my NES days. It was quite different from its
    predecessor – and this was something my brother and I were not prepared for!
    When we rented the game – we couldn’t even get past the first boss no matter
    how much we jumped on his head! It was not until months later that we
    discovered that Mario needs to “pick up” the eggs shot in order to throw
    them back and dispatch Birdo. Nevertheless, over the years. the game has
    found its place in my gamers heart as a whimsical, unique NES game that
    still manages to be fun to this day!
    <br><br>
    The story is strange – likely because it was a game not originally planned
    to be Mario 2! The game starts with Mario (along with Peach, Luigi, and
    Toad) finding a door to a dreamworld! Their goal is to free the world of
    Subcon from Wart the Evil Toad, who has cursed the world world and its people.
    <br><br>
    In terms of gameplay, this game is a 2D platforming game like many in the
    series. The game does introduce some major changes including picking (and
    throwing) vegetables and enemies from the ground in order to dispatch other
    enemies. No longer is jumping a means to getting rid of enemies! Jumping is
    still a core part of the gameplay and is required to get over chasms and
    avoiding enemies. Despite the changes, some familiar Mario tropes are still
    here including mushrooms (that increases your health) and Stars (that make
    you invincible). New additions include cherries that allow you to play a
    slots mini game after each level, and magic potions that open a door to an
    opposite dark world that allows you to find the mushrooms. Ultimately, you
    must guide Mario or one of his three compatriots (Luigi, Peach, and Toad) to
    the end of the stage.
    <br><br>
    Super Marios Bros 2 is an excellent game that improves substantially over
    its predacessor with improved graphics, new gameplay additions, and great
    music. If you enjoy 2D platforming games – give this game a try! Overall,
    I give this game a 8/10.
