  <h1>Retro Throwback #72: Donkey Kong</h1>
  <section class="info">

    <img src="assets/images/dk.png" alt="Donky Kong">Today's edition of Retro
    Throwback features Nintendo’s arcade classic Donkey Kong-
    a fascinating game for all kinds of reasons. In the Eigehties it was
    subject to all sorts of battles, as Universal unsuccessfully sued Nintendo
    over copyright infringement, while Atari and Coleco clashed over conversion
    rights. In the arcades the game has been the battlefield for vicious high
    score competitions, featuring stunning victories and astonishing allegations
    of cheating, and even inspired the documentary "The King Of Kong".
    <br><br>
    Donkey Kong himself went on to become a huge gaming star in his own right,
    appearing across a variety of platform games and a series of music games
    for the GameCube. Oh, and then there’s the small matter of the little bloke
    you play as, some guy named Mario. We don’t quite know what happened to him
    later on. Incidentally, one of our favourite versions of Donkey Kong is the
    excellent Game Boy game, which starts off like the arcade game before
    becoming an astonishing original puzzle platformer.

  <h1>Retro Review #66: Super Mario Bros 2</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h2>Published 26/07/2020</h2>
    <h2>By Jack Sun</h2>
  </section>
  <p>
    <img src="assets/images/smb2.png" alt="SMB 2">Super Mario Bros 2 was a
    game I rented early in my NES days. It was quite different from its
    predecessor – and this was something my brother and I were not prepared for!
    When we rented the game – we couldn’t even get past the first boss no matter
    how much we jumped on his head! It was not until months later that we
    discovered that Mario needs to “pick up” the eggs shot in order to throw
    them back and dispatch Birdo. Nevertheless, over the years. the game has
    found its place in my gamers heart as a whimsical, unique NES game that
    still manages to be fun to this day!
    <br><br>
    The story is strange – likely because it was a game not originally planned
    to be Mario 2! The game starts with Mario (along with Peach, Luigi, and
    Toad) finding a door to a dreamworld! Their goal is to free the world of
    Subcon from Wart the Evil Toad, who has cursed the world world and its people.
    <br><br>
    In terms of gameplay, this game is a 2D platforming game like many in the
    series. The game does introduce some major changes including picking (and
    throwing) vegetables and enemies from the ground in order to dispatch other
    enemies. No longer is jumping a means to getting rid of enemies! Jumping is
    still a core part of the gameplay and is required to get over chasms and
    avoiding enemies. Despite the changes, some familiar Mario tropes are still
    here including mushrooms (that increases your health) and Stars (that make
    you invincible). New additions include cherries that allow you to play a
    slots mini game after each level, and magic potions that open a door to an
    opposite dark world that allows you to find the mushrooms. Ultimately, you
    must guide Mario or one of his three compatriots (Luigi, Peach, and Toad) to
    the end of the stage.
    <br><br>
    Super Marios Bros 2 is an excellent game that improves substantially over
    its predacessor with improved graphics, new gameplay additions, and great
    music. If you enjoy 2D platforming games – give this game a try! Overall,
    I give this game a 8/10.

  <h1>BREAKING NEWS: Luigi faces lifetime ban from Super Mario Bros after third
    failed drug test</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h2>Published 1/04/2020</h2>
    <h2>By Jack Sun</h2>
  </section>
  <p>
    <img src="assets/images/luigi.png" alt="Luigi">The Nintendo Universe was
  shaken to its very core today as news reports surfaced that Luigi had in
  fact failed his third drug test. Luigi is the popular plumber from the
  well-known video game Super Mario Bros. In the game, the object is to save
  Princess Toadstool from the evil dragon Bowser. For years, Luigi has played
  in the shadow of his older brother and speculation is rampant that he was
  looking to gain a competitive edge against Mario, who was always allowed to
  start ahead of him.
  <br><br>
  According to multiple media reports pertaining to the most recent failed drug
  test, Luigi is accused of trading golden coins for anabolic mushrooms and
  koopah antler spray while he was in the sewers of the underwater minus world.
  <br><br>
  Luigi’s older, and of course much more famous brother Mario, spoke first to
  the media because he always goes first.
  <br><br>
  “Thatsah not so good aah,” said Mario. “But let’s aah see if the panel can
  overturn his suspension ok now.”
  <br><br>
  Directly afterwards, Luigi addressed his detractors and talked about his
  appeal against the lifetime ban by stating, “I’m a gonna win.”
  <br><br>
  When pressed for further comment Luigi stuck to his guns.
  <br><br>
  “Luigi is aahh good yes … I’m a gonna win,” he asserted.
  <br><br>
  Not even Luigi’s staunchest defenders, Bill Blaster and the Hammer Brothers,
  could defend his regrettable actions. In a pre-written statement they claimed
  that ever since Luigi fought the False Bowser in Warp World 7 with unlimited
  Lives, he just hadn’t been the same.
  <br><br>
  Previously, Luigi was suspended for three turns from double-player gaming mode
  after using too many Starmen in the Underground Fireball Castle World. Also,
  Luigi had been sanctioned by the Nintendo governing body after refusing a drug
  test when he jumped over the Piranha Plants and onto the top of the flagpole
  in the Buzzy Beetle Overworld to get his 5,000 points.
  <br><br>
  Currently, Luigi is on a leave of absence as he tries to reconcile with his
  ex-girlfriend Princess Toadstool, who was recently seen in the tabloids with
  Mario. Mario explained the pictures of the two of them taken at 3AM outside
  the Mushroom Kingdom by stating that he was merely showing support for a close
  personal friend after her latest abduction by Bowser.

  <h1>Retro Review #65: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</h1>
  <section class="info">
    <h2>Published 19/03/2020</h2>
    <h2>By Jack Sun</h2>
  </section>
  <p>
    <img src="assets/images/alttp.webp" alt="ALTTp"> I am going to be up-front
    with this. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is my favourite game
    ever made. I have been beating it annually for years and have gotten so
    good at it that I beat it in one sitting without dying in a couple of hours.
    It was the game that spurred my brother and I to buy a Super Nintendo in the
    early 90s, so tonight I thought it was as good as time as ever to review it
    for my website.
    <br><br>
    The story is  straightforward but sets the stage for a great adventure. The
    game starts off with a stormy night and Zelda and the seven maidens of
    Hyrule have been captured by the evil Agahnim. Link goes to save them and
    it soon becomes apparent that Ganon is trying to free himself from the dark
    world. The journey takes Link through two worlds, tons of dungeons, finding
    the master sword, and culminates in an epic battle that brings the simple
    story to a satisfying conclusion. And while the story does its job well,
    it isnt really the reason why people love this game so much!
    <br><br>
    In terms of gameplay, this is an action/adventure game. You take control of
    Link from a top down perspective and direct him across Hyrule as you defeat
    enemies, explore dungeons, discover items, and solve puzzles. The B button
    utilizes Links’ sword, and the Y button uses special items
    (i.e., boomerang), and the A button is the action button that allows Link
    to interact with the world like speaking, swimming, lifting things, and
    dashing. The game uses a similar progression system as Metroid in that as
    Link discovers new items, new areas become accessible on the world map,
    which continues until the end of the game! I love this aspect of the game
    as it really encourages exploration – and there is much exploration needed
    as secrets are abound throught! This system also makes the game hard to put
    down as there is always one new area or secret to find!
    <br><br>
    In summary, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is the best
    action/adventure game I have ever played. It has awesome gameplays, a killer
    soundtrack, and packed to the brim with Nintendo charm. If you have never
    played this game, you owe it to yourself to go out and play it. While it is
    an adventure game, it also has tons of replay value and is so good, I have
    been playing through it annually for the past 20 years! I give this game a
    perfect final score of 10/10!
